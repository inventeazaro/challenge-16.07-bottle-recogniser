# challenge-16.07-bottle-recogniser
This is a Capture the Flag type challenge part of the GoHard platform that has a reward in Prey that you can exchange for loot - electronic components. To participate you must first finish the basic challenges and become a Wolf! Read all about it on the website https://gohard.inventeaza.ro/ . GoHard!

You need to use the NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit to detect the following items: plastic bottles (up to 5L), glass bottles/jars and aluminium cans. Any item that doesn’t fit in these three categories should be identified as Other (we do not care what it is, but we want to know it is not one of the three distinct recyclable items). 

Constraints:
- Use the JetPack SDK
- Use the image dataset from the git repository which is provided below (from the resources folder)

Hardware requirements:
- NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit
- HDMI cable + monitor
- keyboard
- 5V power supply

If you do not have the above items, once you have an idea on how to solve the challenge you can come by our office to work from there and we’ll provide the hardware modules that you need to work on this bounty. Just make sure to tell us in time, so we’ll be prepared.

Deliverables: 
- Detection program source code
- Documentation, including step by step instructions (starting from the point when you have the image written on the SD card). What did you install, how should one use your program?

The key for this bounty is a password provided by us after testing your deliverables. Clone the bellow repository on your laptop and make a pull request with your deliverables. You are allowed up to 3 pull requests for this challenge, so make sure you carefully read and solve all the requirements. We regularly check the pull requests in the repository, so the first to submit the deliverables that best meet the requirements for this bounty will get the Howls/Prey. Similarly, if your pull request does not include all the necessary deliverables or the code submitted is not functional, the pull request will be rejected and the next in line will be accepted. If you can fix it in time it can be you!
